# BarnyardTrainer
A 'trainer' application for the video game Barnyard.

Note that there are different builds of Barnyard released but this trainer is built to work with the version available for download on the [Barnyard Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/4WD8sF28RU).

## Installation
To use, simply download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/Break-Ben/BarnyardTrainer/releases/latest), and run `Barnyard Trainer.exe`.

## Features
This tool contains 25+ cheats including:  
+  Flight
+  No-clip
+  Infinite stamina
+  Infinite milk ammo
+  Infinite money
+  Fast ladder
+  Movement controls (speed, jump, acceleration etc)
+  Various camera controls
+  First-person mode (WIP)
+  And more!

The app also allows you to view live information about the game, see the game's built-in cheats and even change some of the game's registry settings.


## Known Issues
+ The first-person mode is currently incomplete
+ Invulnerability only works on foot
+ The speedometer is not 100% accurate - it fluctuates above/below the actual speed
